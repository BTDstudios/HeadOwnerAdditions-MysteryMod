**HeadOwnerAdditions is a free and open-source highly customisable addon as an alternative or extension to the HeadOwner feature implemented in MysteryMod.**

## Notes
- **The addition to the official addon download menu was already requested on (!)`12.06.2022`(!), but is still waiting for acceptance.**
- Newer MysteryMod versions cannot be supported, as MysteryMod decided against publishing further addon apis for developers `:(`.
